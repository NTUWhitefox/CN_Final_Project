Minimal server and client in C++ (Linux sockets) to support:
- register \<username> \<password>
- login \<username> \<password> \<port_number>
- list
- logout

Additional functionalities:
('|' character is required)
- sendto \<username> | \<msg>
- sendtogroup \<username_1>,\<username_2>,...,\<username_n> | \<msg>
...


spec:
Sending Chat Messages (sendto command):
● Sending Chat Messages
○ The system must implement P2P chatting.
○ Messages are sent directly from client to client; the server is used only for discovery 
(online list, IP/port lookup).
● Hints
○ Client should create a listening socket to receive incoming messages.
○ Clients should inform the server about their listening port upon connection.
○ Clients should obtain other clients’ IP addresses and ports from the server.
● Requirements
○ both sides can exchange messages.
○ Full credit requires basic exception handling

Group chatting (sendtogroup command)
 ● Basic — 10 pts
 ○ Implement a group chatroom (relay mode).
 ○ Clients send messages to the server, which relays them to all members of the room.
 ○ Messages should appear in order.
 ○ Encryption is required.
 ● Bonus — 5 pts (privacy + rekey on membership change)
 ○ The server must not be able to decrypt message content
 (metadata such as room ID, sender ID, timestamps may remain in cleartext).
 ○ Change the group key whenever membership changes (join or leave).


my design:
when get any message from other users, it is printed with format:
[(\<receiving time>) \<username> : \<msg>]
